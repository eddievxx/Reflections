When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you would like to share your work publically, or when you would like to be able to work on other publically availalb repositories, or you would like to be able to use GitHub as a base and work on different computers in different locations.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    You may be working collaborativley and the GitHub code may change with many people's commits, yet you want your local repository to be your own work.
