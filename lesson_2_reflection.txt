What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates a .git file which stores information on files in that directory/repository. The files are all untracked (no commits yet).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
    It is the go-between, where files can be selected to be grouped in one commit. 
What value do you think it offers?
    Without this, you could only commit every file. With the staging area, you can choose which to group together for a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
